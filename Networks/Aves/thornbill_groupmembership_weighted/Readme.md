Taxonomic class|Aves
Population type|free-ranging
Geographical location|Canberra, Australia
Data collection technique|survey scan
Interaction type|group membership
Definition of interaction|Flock membership was identified based on frequent interactions between (such as ‘beating’ for insects) flocks and large gaps between flocks. Association strength of each dyad was calculated using the simple ratio index.
