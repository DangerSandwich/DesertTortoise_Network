Species|*Tursiops truncatus*
Taxonomic class|Mammalia
Population type|free-ranging
Geographical location|Cedar Key, Florida, USA
Data collection technique|survey scan
Interaction type|spatial proximity
Definition of interaction|Interactions characterized by prey capture or persistent incidents of prey searching as indicated by long dives or specialized feeding behaviours with direction shifts between surfacings.
Edge weight type|frequency
Total duration of data collection|124 days
Time resolution of data collection (within a day)|ad libitum
