**Study description**|**value**
Species|*Microtus agrestis*
Taxonomic class|Mammalia
Population type|free-ranging
Geographical location|Northumberland, England
Data collection technique|mark recapture
Interaction type|social projection bipartite
Definition of interaction|An edge was inserted into the network whenever two voles were caught in at least one common trap over the primary trapping sessions being considered
Edge weight type|frequency
Total duration of data collection|6 days
Time resolution of data collection (within a day)|12 hours
Time span of data collection (within a day)|24 hours
Note|Networks represent social data combined over two consecutive trapping sessions at four sites (BHP, KCS, PLJ and ROB). Populations were trapped in ‘primary’ sessions every 28 days from March to November, and every 56 days from November to March.
