Species|*Trichosurus cunninghami*
Taxonomic class|Mammalia
Population type|free-ranging
Geographical location|Cambarville, Victoria, Australia
Data collection technique|logger
Interaction type|social projection bipartite
Definition of interaction|The proximity loggers recorded the identity of interacting individuals (based on a threshold proximity set to detect den-sharing events) and the time and length of those interactions. From these data, den-sharing was recorded as a binary variable with ‘1’ representing an instance of day-time den-sharing and ‘0’ representing the use of separate dens for every pairwise combination of individuals on each of the 223 days of data collection.
